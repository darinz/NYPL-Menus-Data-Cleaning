## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive data cleaning procedures performed on the NYPL "What's on the Menu?" dataset. These procedures were designed to address the data quality issues identified in the previous analysis and prepare the dataset for accurate trend analysis (Use Case U1).

## Project Objectives

### **Primary Goal**
Clean the NYPL "What's on the Menu?" dataset to enable **Use Case U1**: Analysis of trends for the top 10 most popular dishes from 1840 to present.

### **Research Questions**
1. What are the **top 10 dishes** that appear most frequently on menus each year from 1840 to the present?
2. How does the **popularity of these dishes evolve over time**?

### **Scenario**
A food historian aims to study culinary trends by identifying the most frequently appearing dishes for each year from the 1840s to the present, examining how dish popularity evolves over time.

## Tools and Technologies

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRefine** | Data profiling, exploratory analysis, regex cleaning | Interactive data cleaning and standardization |
| **Python (pandas)** | Data manipulation, transformation, automation | Programmatic data processing and validation |
| **Regular Expressions** | Pattern matching and text standardization | Dish name standardization and format validation |


## High-Level Data Cleaning Steps

### **Step 1: Whitespace Standardization**
**Objective**: Remove extraneous whitespace characters that cause inconsistencies

**Tasks**:
- Trim leading and trailing whitespaces in date, dish names, and ID columns
- Collapse consecutive whitespaces between words
- Ensure uniform string formatting across all text fields

**Example**:
```
Before: "  Beef  Steak  "
After:  "Beef Steak"
```

### **Step 2: Text Case Standardization**
**Objective**: Ensure consistent casing for accurate dish name grouping

**Tasks**:
- Convert dish name column to Title Case
- Standardize venue and location names
- Maintain consistency across all text fields

**Example**:
```
Before: "beef steak"
After:  "Beef Steak"
```

### **Step 3: Column Optimization**
**Objective**: Remove unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset

**Tasks**:
- Delete empty description column
- Remove redundant or non-contributing columns
- Optimize dataset structure for analysis

### **Step 4: Dish Name Standardization**
**Objective**: Ensure consistency in dish names for accurate frequency counting

**Method**:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Use regex and clustering to identify variations
- **String Matching**: Apply algorithms to unify similar dish names
- **Validation**: Verify standardization accuracy

**Examples**:
```
"Beef Steak" → "Beef Steak"
"Beef-Steak" → "Beef Steak"
"beefsteak"  → "Beef Steak"
```

### **Step 5: Date Handling and Standardization**
**Objective**: Address missing dates and standardize date formats

**Method**:
- **Missing Date Investigation**: Use contextual information to infer dates
- **Format Standardization**: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Validation**: Ensure all dates are within valid historical range (1840-present)

**Examples**:
```
"01/01/24"     → "2024-01-01"
"Feb 12, 1899" → "1899-02-12"
NULL           → [Inferred or documented]
```

### **Step 6: Duplicate Record Removal**
**Objective**: Eliminate duplicate entries to prevent skewed analysis

**Method**:
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify records with identical menuID, date, and dish name
- **Safe Removal**: Remove duplicates while preserving critical information
- **Verification**: Confirm uniqueness of remaining records

**Example**:
```
MenuID: 1005 | Date: 1899-02-12 | Dish: Chicken Soup  ← KEPT
MenuID: 1006 | Date: 1899-02-12 | Dish: Chicken Soup  ← REMOVED
```

### **Step 7: Data Validation and Constraints**
**Objective**: Ensure logical consistency and data integrity

**Tasks**:
- Replace negative counts with 0
- Validate referential integrity between tables
- Ensure logical constraints (e.g., `times_appeared ≥ menus_appeared`)

## Cleaning Process Summary

### **Before Cleaning**
- Inconsistent dish names
- Missing and malformed dates
- Duplicate records
- Whitespace inconsistencies
- Mixed case formatting
- Empty/redundant columns

### **After Cleaning**
- Standardized dish names
- Complete and consistent date formats
- Unique records only
- Clean text formatting
- Consistent case structure
- Optimized dataset structure


## Rationale for Each Cleaning Step

### **1. Whitespace Standardization**
**Rationale**: Extraneous whitespace causes inconsistencies during analysis. Uniform formatting ensures accurate grouping and counting.

**Impact on U1**: Essential for accurate dish frequency counting and trend analysis.

### **2. Text Case Standardization**
**Rationale**: Inconsistent casing leads to separate counting of identical dishes. Title Case ensures proper grouping.

**Impact on U1**: Critical for accurate popularity analysis and trend identification.

### **3. Column Optimization**
**Rationale**: Empty columns add complexity without value. Streamlined datasets improve analysis efficiency.

**Impact on U1**: Simplifies data processing and reduces computational overhead.

### **4. Dish Name Standardization**
**Rationale**: Multiple variations of the same dish skew frequency counts. Standardization ensures accurate popularity analysis.

**Impact on U1**: **Critical** - Directly affects the accuracy of top 10 dish analysis.

### **5. Date Handling**
**Rationale**: Missing or inconsistent dates prevent temporal analysis. Complete date information enables year-based categorization.

**Impact on U1**: **Essential** - Required for year-by-year trend analysis.

### **6. Duplicate Removal**
**Rationale**: Duplicate records inflate dish popularity counts, distorting trend analysis.

**Impact on U1**: **Critical** - Prevents skewed popularity rankings.

### **7. Data Validation**
**Rationale**: Logical inconsistencies indicate data quality issues that could affect analysis accuracy.

**Impact on U1**: Ensures reliable and trustworthy analysis results.

## Expected Improvements

| Quality Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Data Consistency** | 70% | 95% | +25% |
| **Data Completeness** | 85% | 98% | +13% |
| **Data Accuracy** | 80% | 92% | +12% |
| **Analysis Reliability** | 75% | 96% | +21% |
